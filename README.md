A Music Recommendation System 

This project details the development of a music recommendation system.

The foundation of this system began with the utilization of a public dataset sourced from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solomonameh/spotify-music-dataset]. From this source, I extracted the required features and subsequently created a custom, proprietary dataset of almost 50 users.

The system was developed by synthesizing necessary data from both datasets. It operates by analyzing user-prepared input and applying specific predefined metrics to recommend a highly relevant match. I implemented rigorous filtering techniques to ensure that the user receives song recommendations that are a precise and optimal fit for their taste.

This endeavor represents my initial attempt at developing a large-scale, comprehensive project of this nature.
